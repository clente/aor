        hello!  Funny seeing you here.\n\nI appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't
        going to find much down here.\nThere certainly aren't clues to any of the
        puzzles.  The best surprises don't\neven appear in the source until you unlock
        them for real.\n\nPlease be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive
        company, and I can\nonly take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that
        everyone gets to play.\n\nIf you're curious about how Advent of Code works,
        it's running on some custom\nPerl code. Other than a few integrations (auth,
        analytics, social media), I\nbuilt the whole thing myself, including the design,
        animations, prose, and all\nof the puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles are most of the
        work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of\npuzzles each year takes all
        of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort\nwent into building this thing
        - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I\nenjoyed making it for you!\n\nIf
        you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.\n\n- Eric Wastl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-->\n<body>\n<header><div><h1

        Day 1: Sonar Sweep ---</h2><p>You're minding your own business on a ship at
        sea when the overboard alarm goes off! You rush to see if you can help. Apparently,
        one of the Elves tripped and accidentally sent the sleigh keys flying into
        the ocean!</p>\n<p>Before you know it, you're inside a submarine the Elves
        keep ready for situations like this. It's covered in Christmas lights (because
        of course it is), and it even has an experimental antenna that should be able
        to track the keys if you can boost its signal strength high enough; there's
        a little meter that indicates the antenna's signal strength by displaying
        0-50 <em class=\"star\">stars</em>.</p>\n<p>Your instincts tell you that in
        order to save Christmas, you'll need to get all <em class=\"star\">fifty stars</em>
        by December 25th.</p>\n<p>Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will
        be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is
        unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants <em class=\"star\">one
        star</em>. Good luck!</p>\n<p>As the submarine drops below the surface of
        the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor.
        On a small screen, the sonar sweep report (your puzzle input) appears: each
        line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and
        further away from the submarine.</p>\n<p>For example, suppose you had the
        following report:</p>\n<pre><code>199\n200\n208\n210\n200\n207\n240\n269\n260\n263\n</code></pre>\n<p>This
        report indicates that, scanning outward from the submarine, the sonar sweep
        found depths of <code>199</code>, <code>200</code>, <code>208</code>, <code>210</code>,
        and so on.</p>\n<p>The first order of business is to figure out how quickly
        the depth increases, just so you know what you're dealing with - you never
        know if the keys will get <span title=\"Does this premise seem fishy to you?\">carried
        into deeper water</span> by an ocean current or a fish or something.</p>\n<p>To
        do this, count <em>the number of times a depth measurement increases</em>
        from the previous measurement. (There is no measurement before the first measurement.)
        In the example above, the changes are as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>199 (N/A
        - no previous measurement)\n200 (<em>increased</em>)\n208 (<em>increased</em>)\n210
        (<em>increased</em>)\n200 (decreased)\n207 (<em>increased</em>)\n240 (<em>increased</em>)\n269
        (<em>increased</em>)\n260 (decreased)\n263 (<em>increased</em>)\n</code></pre>\n<p>In
        this example, there are <em><code>7</code></em> measurements that are larger
        than the previous measurement.</p>\n<p><em>How many measurements are larger
        than the previous measurement?</em></p>\n</article>\n<p>Your puzzle answer
        was <code>1228</code>.</p><article class=\"day-desc\"><h2 id=\"part2\">---
        Part Two ---</h2><p>Considering every single measurement isn't as useful as
        you expected: there's just too much noise in the data.</p>\n<p>Instead, consider
        sums of a <em>three-measurement sliding window</em>.  Again considering the
        above example:</p>\n<pre><code>199  A      \n200  A B    \n208  A B C  \n210
        \   B C D\n200  E   C D\n207  E F   D\n240  E F G  \n269    F G H\n260      G
        H\n263        H\n</code></pre>\n<p>Start by comparing the first and second
        three-measurement windows. The measurements in the first window are marked
        <code>A</code> (<code>199</code>, <code>200</code>, <code>208</code>); their
        sum is <code>199 + 200 + 208 = 607</code>. The second window is marked <code>B</code>
        (<code>200</code>, <code>208</code>, <code>210</code>); its sum is <code>618</code>.
        The sum of measurements in the second window is larger than the sum of the
        first, so this first comparison <em>increased</em>.</p>\n<p>Your goal now
        is to count <em>the number of times the sum of measurements in this sliding
        window increases</em> from the previous sum. So, compare <code>A</code> with
        <code>B</code>, then compare <code>B</code> with <code>C</code>, then <code>C</code>
        with <code>D</code>, and so on. Stop when there aren't enough measurements
        left to create a new three-measurement sum.</p>\n<p>In the above example,
        the sum of each three-measurement window is as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>A:
        607 (N/A - no previous sum)\nB: 618 (<em>increased</em>)\nC: 618 (no change)\nD:
        617 (decreased)\nE: 647 (<em>increased</em>)\nF: 716 (<em>increased</em>)\nG:
        769 (<em>increased</em>)\nH: 792 (<em>increased</em>)\n</code></pre>\n<p>In
        this example, there are <em><code>5</code></em> sums that are larger than
        the previous sum.</p>\n<p>Consider sums of a three-measurement sliding window.
        <em>How many sums are larger than the previous sum?</em></p>\n</article>\n<p>Your
